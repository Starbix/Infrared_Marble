## Quickstart

**Requirements:**

-   A recent version of Docker and Docker Compose
-   A few GB of free disk space

After cloning this repo or downloading the source files, you can start up the application with:

```sh
bin/start.sh
```

on macOS/Linux, and with

```cmd
bin/start.bat
```

Note: The Windows start script is untested. The app should still run on Windows though (check [Set Up](#set-up) if the
start script does not work).

## Set Up

### Docker Image Only

The code is available on Docker Hub with pre-built images for x86 and ARM. To run the app, you'll need the
`docker-compose.prod.yaml` file, as this sets up the containers and contains a Black Marble API token. Once you have
obtained the `docker-compose.prod.yaml` file, run:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up --pull=always
```

This should start all the containers. Note that the API needs to download some data on first startup, which could take
up to a few minutes. The app won't work before you see:

```
server   Server started at http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

You can then access the web UI at <http://localhost:3000>.

### Full Project Setup

You can run the latest production version of the application locally with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Please
install it and make sure that the `docker compose` command is available.

**Steps for full setup:**

1. Clone the code or obtain source through other means
2. Inside of the source directory, you should run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. Then, depending on what you want to do, run one of:

    ```sh
    docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up --build
    ```

    for a production build based on the latest files, or

    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build --watch
    ```

    for a development instance with hot-reloading enabled.
